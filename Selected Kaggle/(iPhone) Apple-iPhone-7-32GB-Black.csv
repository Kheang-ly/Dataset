"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Cori L Reece,5,Bought phone and within 24 hours of recieving product it stopped working. Contacted seller they offered 20$ to replace the battery that cost 60$ and then I also had to replace the charging port. I would not recommend buying from them unless you plan on rebuilding the complete phone again.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Meet,2,"That is one reason I like brand new iPhones, otherwise, the battery starts dying super quick because they are not original batteries. I am glad it happened during the return period. I sent it back. Better to spend more than sorry."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Kattwhite,1,I bought this phone in July and by December it started having issues. Now it doesn't read the SIM card at all so the phone will not work. NEVER buying renewal phone from Amazon again. What I paid for the Renewed phone I know can get a brand new one for a little less.

The phone is literally less than half a year old since I purchased it. I tried to contact the seller to see if there is a solution. But I haven't heard anything from him/her. Really really bad customer service and terrible products he/she is selling."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sadiyah Na Phoniey,5,"The phone worked for 1-2months. After that, the would not charge. Don‚Äôt this phone or anyone sold on Amazon. Save your money and buy it from apple."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sydnie white,1,"So I got this phone, when it originally came, it had more damage than what was listed so I returned it. The next one that came in had little to no damage so I was excited. However, after the 30 day return window (of course) the phone has been having all sorts of problems. I have audio issues with my phone on speaker, the keyboard gets stuck constantly, and the battery life is pretty much non-existent. Incredibly pissed I bought this for 230$ and now can only get 60$ if I sell it back. Just a warning, but if you buy your phone from here you are gambling with your money honestly. So just do a payment plan through your provider or get it from apple and spare yourself the frustration"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Shannon DeMarino,5,"I ordered this phone, already knowing that I didn't want an IPhone, unfortunately this phone got very hot very fast, luckily the seller is very understanding and very helpful. I am returning the phone for a refund. I have to say that the fingerprint sensor is great, as well as the touchscreen. As far as the battery goes, well it's an IPhone, be prepared to always have your charger with you. This would have been a great value for the money for sure, but unfortunately I couldn't deal with how hot the phone would get."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Andrew Clay,1,"The phone glitches all the time by itself, it clicks random things and loads random pages... Definitely not what I expected for what I paid"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,H. G.,4,Everything works well. Very happy. The best part was the new phone's ability to copy everything from my old phone! It was fast too!

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Imaothog,1,Do not buy. Our phone software was faulty. The first update killed the phone per the Apple Store. Said it was a common problem with the 7's.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,laura,1,Plugged it in today and transferred my data to the phone. Phone isn‚Äôt charging past 60 %. Going through battery settings shows the battery is severely compromised. I had to order a replacement battery off Amazon today. I would suggest avoiding purchasing a phone through this seller as quality control is clearly lacking.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,R. Riffer,1,Steer clear of this company and phone. Broke 4 days after the 90 day warranty expired.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Nicole Dennison,1,It did not come with a memory card or something heart. The battery life is really short on it. And when using it for a while or using it on the charger. The phone gets hot. Really hot. Total waste of money. And I hate the fact that i can't switch over already played games. On certain games. Because they are set up with a gmail account. Not a iCloud account.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sandra Watkins,5,I purchased this phone for my nephew and it‚Äôs practically new. Everything works great. There weren‚Äôt any scratches or anything to the phone nor any issues with adding service to it. I use consumer cellular carrier and it works perfectly!

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sasha,5,"It‚Äôs a GREAT phone!! I read the reviews and was kind of worried but it turned out great , my carrier lock provider was boost mobile but that‚Äôs a good thing because that‚Äôs my regular provider. The only thing is that it doesn‚Äôt come with a sim card which is no big deal for me. But all in all it‚Äôs a great phone and I am happy with the price because I bought 2 phones for the price of 290 or 300 I believe"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,5,"Always go with the refurbished phones on Amazon. Good value for the money. Nice phone, works well, better camera. I did not like that for it being refurbished that a brand new battery was not installed. It did have 95% life but I think that a new battery should always be part of the refurbishing. It should come with 100% life. Otherwise no complaints"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Tony Hensley,2,When you put the phone to your ear to listen you can hardly hear them it‚Äôs real low and it‚Äôs all the way up does that mean it‚Äôs broken probably cuz my case was broken also
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,r3d5,5,"The iPhone 7 I received works well. I tested it fully & installed the latest OS (as of today it is iOS 14.4) and found no problems. Cosmetically it is also in good shape. I think my seller replaced the battery too, because it says ""100%"" capacity in settings. Much to my delight, it also works with Verizon, as I intended to only use it as a wifi tablet (I love computers & devices and wanted a pocket computer that has stereo speakers). I don't know if it works on all other networks, but in the settings it says ""No Sim Restrictions"" so I assume it does. Just be careful when buying any iPhone- message the seller and make sure they confirm it works on your network. That way if it doesn't, you can say you asked before. Note: I'm using the iPhone 7 I got as a tablet, so in the picture I shared it says ""No Sim."" But mine works with Verizon, as I tested it already."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Jackie,1,The speaker did not work

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Brittany & Sean,4,"Renewed is not new. This phone lasted about 8 months before the charger stopped working right. Bought every charger made and nothing made difference, However it still works just chargers super slow and super picky how it chargers."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Stefanie,4,Battery life isn't good. Haven't had for a couple weeks and it's telling us to replace low battery capacity. Other than that very nice phone but iPhone batteries are not cheap to replace. Correction! They made it right!!!
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Summer,1,"The phone doesn‚Äôt hold a charge and the charger didn‚Äôt work, I tried to contact the seller and they never replied!"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Michael,1,Only the home button works. The touch screen is inoperable. Returning the phone for a refund.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Christopher Rafter,3,"Ok so LUCKILY I ordered this iPhone for the sake of a quality WiFi device so my issue isn‚Äôt TERRIBLE. Upon receiving the phone and setting it up and using it with flying colors, I discover that the SIM tray was literally glued shut for WHATEVER reason. So, Even if I wanted to activate it as a serviced phone, I couldn‚Äôt. Ultimately, I‚Äôm not mad but I still would have loved to save a 20 dollar bill for the inconvenience... That‚Äôs what happens when you buy a refurbished product online, you hope for the best and expect the worst. It happens from time to time even in face to face transactions."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Luisanna Zamora,5,The product is working as expected for an iphone. I purchased the phone for an att prepaid plan for my mother and had no barriers or issues with connection. The quality is great for a Refurbished phone.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,1,The phone will not charge and its always at 1% and always have to be plugged in. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unsafe for use. I need a refund or a replacement. Plugged in overnight and still no charge greater than1%
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Matt,5,Battery health was at 85% of original capacity which was well within range. Overall the phone worked great. I‚Äôm very satisfied

It's really frustrating to have received this with 0 battery and life and then when I decided to charge and install updates, the screen is completely unresponsive. I don't even know what to do at this point besides refund it. Trust the bad reviews and stay away."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,ashley,5,My phone was fully unlocked as promised. Everything works great in the phone . No problems what so ever. Everything on the phone works like a brand new one. I go through Appalachian wireless. Which is the cdma network and my SIM card worked perfectly. I would recommend buying this phone from this seller to anyone. NOTE:(not all phones sold on Amazon are from the same seller).
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Candace,5,Not many businesses out there actually beat Amazon delivery speeds but oh this one did! My daughter lost her phone and we were trying to get one here before the weekend and Avant came through and a day early I might add. The phone is in perfect condition battery is charging without problems and holds a charge. No defects or imperfections or anything. The charger is new and works.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,shyla,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ‚Äúrenewed‚Äù phone. It has a known antenna issue. If it is working for you, beware that you might be one iOS update away from owning a BRICK! My family got this for me for Father‚Äôs Day and it bricked at iOS 14.1. Went into a constant ‚Äúverifying update‚Äù. When I did a hard reset, a message- can‚Äôt connect to carrier came up....too many issues. Took it to Apple and they very kindly agreed to try to fix the known issue but warned me the phone may have after market parts that might preclude them from the repair....we will see in 10 days. Either way...Dont Do It! Or...spend some extra on extended warranty if it‚Äôs available. This phone WILL fail."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Bryce T.,1,My son saved his money up to get this phone and only 1 year later the phone is now a brick and apple will do nothing without paying 359.00 to fix the manufacturing defect that these sellers phones seem to have.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,1,This phone would say it was changed at 100% and soon as you took it off the charger the phone would die. Did not hold charge and some random button was on the screen and there was no way of getting rid of it. If I could give this item zero stars that‚Äôs what it would have got. Seller on the other hand responded quickly and was very understanding.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Brian C.,5,"I bought this phone as a christmas gift for my dad. When the phone arrived, I noticed some cosmetic flaws on the back. I wrote a brief ""complaint"" online. I received a response from the seller, Electronic Deals, immediately. The gentleman I received an e-mail from was Albert. He urged me to call him and Albert left his personal cell #. I called and got an apology right away. No excuses. He asked how he could make my experience 100% satifactory. Albert offered to send me a replacement phone right away. After talking with Albert I decided to keep the phone, knowing I would have a case on it and the flaws would not be seen. We decided on a fair compromise that we both could live with. Albert (Electronic Deals) was the utmost professional. Down to earth and understanding my dilemma, he done everything he could to make me happy about this purchase. Albert offered me choices with no restrictions. I wished all sellers could be more like Electronic Deals. I recommend to everyone to buy from Albert and this outstanding seller. I will definitely be a life long customer of Electronic Deals. Thank you Albert."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Thania Romilus,1,"I just bought This iPhone 7 unlock. I have made the purchase on the 14th of January 2021 and had just received the iPhone on 26th of January 2021 I‚Äôve paid $77.86 to clear the phone. When I received the phone it was dead so I put it on charge with the charger that came with the phone and the charger was not working so I had to use an old iPhone charger I had here. The phone finally came on for me to set up my iCloud. While setting up my iCloud it carry me to a page to load all my information so I rest the phone down so it can finish load all my information. When I went back to the phone I noticed that it was turned off so i tried turning it back on with the power button and it did came on so I unplugged the charger and plugged it back in and leave the phone, the phone came back on put my fingerprint on to unlock it and it didn‚Äôt recognize my fingerprint so tried to put in my passcode and noticed the screen was not working. I emailed the people to put in my complaint before leaving a negative reply and no one replied to my email. I‚Äôm advising everyone not to waste your hard working money. I had to carry the phone to a technician here to fix it and he told me the screen was not the original screen and had to pay an extra 75$ to get it fix."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,jeff,5,"I gave my Iphone 7 to my son when when I got an Iphone 8 that was a bad call. My 8 went out after only a month and then my new one gave me nothing but issue after issue for the next 12 months. So I decided to buy a used 7 and I had never done that before. I read most all the reviews and the description from the seller first. The seller description is pretty clear on the state of the battery and I never let any of my Iphones I have owned get below 85 percent battery health because I use my phone a lot and all day for work and they seem to start working weird below 80 percent battery health so with that in mind I purchased a battery in anticipation that the battery would be below 85 percent like in the description. They both arrived quickly and my phone came from Seller ""TECHMINT"" and was listed a Verizon phone. So far after about 4 days everything is working perfect and I am almost done with the second draining of the battery completely before charging back up to condition a new battery and I will do it a total of three times. Not sure it really helps but I have either gotten lucky or it does work because I have replaced about 6 batteries in six different phones for me and my family and they work pretty darn good. As for getting back into a 7 it is pretty nice not having the issues of the 8. I could not believe how bad my experience was with the iphone 8 and after having a 6 and a 7 back to back with almost zero issues it wasn't pleasant. I will do an update after I have had it for a while."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Anthony,1,Buyer beware: iPhone model A1660... When I bought this phone I was so excited; it was my newest upgrade to my iPhone SE. It looked beautiful and it felt great in the hand. Little did I know that a certain model of this phone that was built in China would start rejecting my sim card. Every so often it would tell me that I had no service. I would take the same SIM card out and put it in another phone and it would work just fine. Please make sure you research the model and where it's made so that you don't end up like me spending money on a phone that doesn't work. Even when I took the phone to the iPhone store they said I was not eligible to get the phone recalled or even fixed. Such a waste.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,James Judge,2,Its battery has caved and the Lightning socket will not reliably charge. This is NOT a refurbished phone. It's really hard to determine whether they did anything but see if it would charge at all and then sent it out.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,1,"I ordered this phone in September 2020, it is now March 2021 and it no longer works. I understand it is a refurbished device but the supposed ""30 pt inspection"" is obviously faulty. Everything was fine, phone was in great working order until the past month or so (5 mo. mark) when the battery would drop drastically and soon, my phone had to be plugged into a power source to even turn on. Now, it does not turn on at all, even when plugged into a power source. I contacted the seller and was told it is not their problem as ""we have no way of knowing when issues will arise"" and there is only a 90 day warranty, aka just enough time that once it breaks you are right outside the warranty. I would not recommend this phone or seller, it is a cheap refurbishment that will break in less than a year, and possibly a scam completely Better to spend ~$80-$100 more from a better seller."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,steve,5,The phone arrived in pristine condition. You could not tell it was refurbished. But more importantly what I like about the seller was communication. The seller has a very high approval rating. I see most third-party sellers 15 to 20 points lower in approval. If you read the reviews the majority of the negative reviews have to do communication. They were a few bumps along the road with a sale but the sellers communication was almost instantaneous every time I wrote a message. I have had my phone for a week now. It works great. Good battery life. I am extremely happy

Ended up having to buy a new phone. Really disappointed that I spent almost $200 on a phone that didn‚Äôt even last a year.

It wouldn‚Äôt connect to any network then it said to update after up dating it said the phone is unable to activate and that message won‚Äôt go off the screen so u can do nothing.

Specifically, phone calls ONLY work when I put the call on speaker so if I do not have the speaker on, I cannot hear the person at all - but for some reason, they can hear me no matter what. I have tried restarting my phone, playing with volume, resetting my phone, and doing everything in the books to try and fix this, but the phone clearly arrived broken. I want a refund and a different phone."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Newbwrangler,1,Pos. I bought this assuming I was getting a decent phone just a few gens behind but the price was constant with others only. Terrible first off I had to send it in to get it to update because something was wrong with the o/s and secondly the battery life is pure garbage not only does it only last made an hour and a half on a full charge before dying but also runs super hot. Don‚Äôt not buy from this seller cause they clearly don‚Äôt test their products or don‚Äôt care about their customers. What a waste of $$$$200!!!!!!

The phone stopped working and I contacted the insurance company Asurion. They are giving me an Amazon card to repurchase another one. The problem is the year and a half I have left on the insurance in voided. Another phone and I will have to pay another 50 dollars for insurance. Asurion will not cover my new phone for the rest of the contract. This is what Amazon is selling for insurance.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Rylie Williams,1,This is not the first renewed phone I have purchased from amazon and typically they are like brand new phones with less battery life but for some reason this particular phone I am having all kinds of problems. From the first seller I chose the phone I received looked brand new but had a dreadful battery under the advertised 80 percent and needed to be replaced so I sent that one back and ordered another one from another seller. This second phone has decent battery life but looks like complete and utter crap. The casing is scuffed and pitted everywhere and the screen is horribly scratched. If you are going to buy a renewed phone I would try a newer product.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Spgerlach,3,Obviously; they didn‚Äôt bother with replacing the battery.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Dora Jennings,3,The phone had some minor issues with functionality. It may be because it was a pre-owned phone. It would have been better if it had more of a battery life.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amber Nelson,5,Battery life isn‚Äôt as long as newer phones. Touch screen is good responsive. It‚Äôs not to thick good fit for pockets. Image quality of photos is not that great.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Berny Solano,2,"There are times when a phone is set to support another carrier, and even after a full factory reset, any carrier update will kill your mobile network. Happened to me. Sprint/T-mobile reset it and tried multiple times, and every time we got it to work, it would lose full mobile connectivity in less than a day. That means no calls, no text, no internet if you're outside of wifi. Be warned and keep your old phone handy. You may be disappointed like i was."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Cristina Rojas,1,"The most terrible and worst decision ever made was to purchase a phone from this seller.

I didn‚Äôt know that this specific model was actually a recalled model back when they initially released the phone. I do not recommend buying from a seller who sells recalled items. I contacted them and they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. This was their reply. ‚Äú I am sorry this has happed, however, the item is no longer covered under warranty.‚Äù At least learn how to type correctly. Such a rip off.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Kimberly Davis,1,I really wanted to live this phone snd I was SO excited to receive it. When I powered it on it was charged to 90%. I started setting it up and it got REALLY hot really fast. Within 30 minutes it had dropped from 90% to 56%. The more I used it I noticed the touch screen is super unresponsive also. In the 11 hours I have had this phone I had had to charge it 3 time and it just will not hold a charge.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Joe M.,5,"After reading a few reviews, I took a chance and ordered the IPhone 7 fully unlocked. I was shock to find a almost new phone, almost flawless, just some hard to notice marks on the corners, you would have to look really close to see or notice it. And yes it was fully unlocked both GSM and CDMA, in other words any carrier from T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, ect. I'm happy with it. Update: The phone can with 75% battery life left, does hold charge most of the day. Not bad for a 5 year old phone."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Kenji Matsumoto,4,"Have had it for about a week now, and no problems. Came with 91% battery capacity which was expected. No aftermarket parts that I could tell. Screen looks good. Only complaint was that there was some light paint dust on the back but it is purely cosmetic. I‚Äôll update at month one! 90 day warranty is a nice factor. I was hesitant to buy when I read some of these reviews, but I seem to have gotten it good. So that is possible if you are considering buying. If you don‚Äôt like it, then you‚Äôve got 90 days. There you go bud."

It came in a white-unmarked box with SIM removal tool and a lighting charger (non apple). The phone is near new condition, not a scratch that I can see. Will activate later today, test battery life, etc. Overall, one nice deal without buying a new phone from a service provider. I always prefer to stay a few models behind the latest and greatest of Apple phones, as the prices are too damn high IMHO. You shouldn't be disappointed with this seller. I will buy from them again, as my wife needs an upgrade soon."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Brandon Stalvey,1,I ordered 2 of these for my siblings first phone. I was unaware of a pretty big issue that the 7's had with updates. Apparently companies are capable of fixing the issue but most won't anymore because it's such an older device. So both of my siblings when trying to update were unsuccessful and now they cannot use their service or data on it. It requires the update to use the sim card but fails to update

Me puse en contacto con amazon pero ya hab√≠an pasado 100 d√≠as en lugar de 90 y se desentendieron. Su recomendaci√≥n es que lo vea directamente con apple. EN apple me explicaron que los iphone 7 viene con una falla que ellos arreglaban hasta una fecha. Los iphone 7 que quedan en el mercado ya no est√°n cubiertos. Es por tanto falso que el Iphone que compr√© yo haya sido refurbished porque el fallo ven√≠a de la placa base. Cualquier compra de iphone 7 ""refurbished"" a trav√©s de amazon es susceptible de que ocurra lo mismo."

Because I was in a situation where I couldn‚Äôt wait for a return, I had to get the battery replaced at my expense. When the technician opened the phone there was clear damage to components on the inside. One component looked like it came out of a phone that had a battery fire.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Aimy,3,UPDATE: This company did keep trying to send a different replacement. We‚Äôve finally got a good phone. Thank you. Original review: The phone might be a good product but when buying used it‚Äôs a gamble. And it certainly has been the case buying from this company. It says Amazon certified but it‚Äôs a 3rd party company so who knows what they give you. This is our second time returning a phone back to the them because they are in some way defective. We are kind of left hanging on what to do next and we are still out of a phone. Again.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,MiMi,1,Phone worked ok but the battery wouldn't last over 4 hours or less with use they must have forgotten to refurbished it. Always nervous about buying refurbished electronics because there is almost always a reason it was refurbished there's no way to know if it was just a trade in for a newer phone or because it wasn't working.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Kinsey Love,5,"Yes! This phone has gotten terrible reviews, but I received this phone, no scratches or dents, etc, camera is working well. And the home button works. Apps are working. I have not inserted a sim card in yet, and it seems a previous user tried to wipe the phone clean, but I wanted to sign in myself with my own apple Id, so I just did a factory reset and erased everything so sign in. That did the trick to make the phone completely new. I suggest do getting this phone! Great price, works amazing. I got the rose gold one. Fully unlocked."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sharon Scheible,1,"I really wanted this to work. I am fine to have an iPhone that‚Äôs not the latest model. Unfortunately this iPhone worked well for only 3 months. Now it turns off randomly, reboots, screen freezes, I have to force a reboot. Many times a day. When it works, it‚Äôs fine, but then it turns off and I never know when it will do this. And it‚Äôs not the battery. I just threw $170 dollars down the drain that I should have just put toward a new phone. I expect a renewed item to work at least 1-2 years. And it‚Äôs past 90 days, so I can‚Äôt return. Very disappointed Amazon. Some of these renewed iPhones may work, but buyer beware. And if you notice anything weird in the first 90 days, send it back. Mine literally started acting up just a week or 2 past the 90 days."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Jim,1,I gave everything 1 star because even though I know these phones are used you would think the phone would last longer than 2 months after paying over $200 for it . I emailed the company only to receive an email back telling me they are closed so I looked the company up and sure enough it says they are permanently closed . Next step is to contact Amazon but since I didn't pay the $79 product warranty I'm sure I'm out my money .

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Jesse smith,1,"First, I'd like to say that I received the phone 3 weeks after it had been marked as delivered. Whatever, no big deal right? Well, we've had this phone since April, and around mid may the speakers on the phone stopped working, both microphone and headset audio devices, dead. Who the hell at amazon still allows these retailers to sell hacked phones? I could tell from the get go something was off about the speakers, but just figured it might've been a part that was replaced as it was refurbished equipment. Ok, sure, annoying as hell, but whatever. BUT NOW, trying to finally get around to requesting a refund or a replacement for the phone, MY WARENTY HAS DISAPEARED? Way to take advantage of people during a pandemic. ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL!"

It needs an update that it refuses to install. ‚ÄúInstall new update so you can use cellular data!‚Äù ‚ÄúCannot install new update without cellular data!‚Äù When you google the errors and the model, you can see that their only resolution is to send Apple back the device, preferably before March of 2018, which means it really should have gone back at least 3 years ago?

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,1,"I bought this phone for my husband because of the storage and its promise to be ""like new"". When we first received the phone, we were annoyed to find that the front camera didn't work and the battery only lasted an hour or two before dying. After 4 months of owning the phone, it completely stopped working. Would not receive or make calls and couldn't send texts unless connected to wifi. We took to the Apple store and they said that this model was discontinued because of this issue, and there was nothing they could do. My husband ended up having to buy a completely new phone. I wouldn't purchase from this seller as it was promised to be ""like new"" and it obviously was not."

They allowed a return with full refund because the unit I received had less than advertised battery life remaining, got hot to the touch on power up, and lightning port was bad. I am sure with all the units they ship there is a dud in there sometimes. I got the bad one. I expect that is a chance anyone will be taking with a purchase like this. But they took care of it."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Armando Gonzalez,2,"I was really disappointed with my purchase. I am usually not when I buy from Amazon, but this time I am. I bought the iPhone 7 , not with high expectations, but I was hoping for better. I bought it because I wanted to upgrade from my 6S. I‚Äôm not big on bells and whistles, but I wanted an upgrade. I bought the phone because the battery in my 6 was dying really fast. I have had the phone for, I think three years now, and my battery life was terrible. I had to keep it on charger a lot. So, I decided to purchase the 7, which was planned for about 3 months. I received it when I was told I was going too and I was pretty excited. I turn it on on the charger and transferred all the data from my 6. Then, when it was all transferred, I noticed that the battery on the 7 was low. As I have been using it the battery life in the phone is the same as my 6 and I‚Äôm constantly having to charge it. On the plus side, I just got and I have 90 days to return it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm returning it and getting my money back. It‚Äôs a great phone otherwise, just battery is terrible. Wish it would‚Äôve been better, but nope! I may just buy a new battery for iPhone 6s from Amazon and put it in my six and see how that work instead of getting another one."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Nicole Harris,4,The phone itself is great but the microphone quit working on the one I received. It is December and I ordered the phone in February of the same year. I loved the phone when it was working and the price was good but I guess that is what you get when you order a refurbished phone. Now I am on the hunt to replace my phone once again.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Theodore M Wong,4,"I ordered from Trademore to get a refurbished iPhone 7, and it arrived fully ready to go out of the box with the latest iOS version installed. All I needed to do was add in my SIM chip and sign on with my Apple ID, and iCloud Backup restore did the rest. The unit I received works like new and was actually flat (as opposed to some other refurbs I've had); it had some scratching on the glass, but not over the actual display area. Trademore and Amazon refurbs may seemed more expensive than refurbs from elsewhere, but it's worth it for a great unit with no hassles or technical gotchas."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sheldon B.,3,"My phone works well. Touch screen responsive. There were a few small chips on the sides of the phone by the speaker and near the volume buttons. The back of the phone however, was nowhere near excellent conditions and frankly a bit disappointing. I keep it in a case anyway so that part of the phone is not displayed. All in all the phone part of it is 10 out of 10 but the outside body of the phone is a hard six."

The phone also came with an Apple charging cord, and brick. The brick looked like it may have been used. The phone came in a white box and on the outside had a paper sleeve that was ‚ÄúVerizon Certified‚Äù and has ‚ÄúGreat‚Äù written on the side. I purchased this phone for only $173, and it came with free 2-day shipping! I can‚Äôt wait to surprise her with her new phone, she‚Äôs going to be so happy!

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Lexy,1,"I've owed the product for over a month or two. This product is clearly used, it's not even shipped in the original box. Often the phone is still dirty as if is was just taking out of the phone case for years. The cord is not iPhone original some weird off brand ""Ashley"". The speaker for phone calls must have been damaged I can't hear much. I resort to speaker a lot unforcefully, which leaves no room for privacy. The touch screen is iffy, not sure if it the phone case and or the new abilities with the 7 (touch sensitive). Either way it doesn't always respond to my finger. Or it'll erase what I just typed in.... Maybe the previous owner allowed water damage. There no prier info on these phones either, which would be greatly appreciated. Lastly the home screen ""button"" clicks when I just touch the bottom parts of my phone. I don't know ppl this was supposed to be my new forever phone, unfortunately with the prier damage I'll have to buy another phone in the next year to come. $200 is not a joke right now in our times."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Lady Lawyer in Progress,4,"Update #1: I just got the new IPhone 7 here from Hybrid IT yesterday. It came faster than expected; one day early. Phone looks good, of course knowing it was a renewed, I expected flaws; which it does have. But it's not really bothersome unless you're a perfectionist and you assume the phone will come without flaws and perfect. You'd be disappointed. The screen had a (blue/green) line in the corner of the phone. It's not too noticible if I use a dark background and it doesn't bother me. Also you can tell previous owner used a case because of the color fade around the camera area and some paint chip where you plug it in to charge. The flaws are really no big deal because I only use it to text and talk when I'm out and about in NYC, basically it's just a backup phone. I hate carrying my bigger phone with me when I shop. So this one is much smaller and easier to have on me. So I'm satisfied with my purchase from Hybrid IT so far. I will update here if anything changes. I would like to add, that a lot of these reviews here are not all reviews from on specific seller. So be sure to do research on the seller instead of relying on all these reviews here. Because the bad sellers could be selling bad products while the good sellers sell good ones. They just put them all into one review. So be sure to do research not only on the phone but the seller too. Don't just rely on Amazon reviews. Check online too."

Tried calling my cellphone provider on a different cellphone and the phone was the problem. Out of the box it worked fine. Could be used as an iPod but there was no service. Works fine technically but not $169 for a iPhone that doesn‚Äôt work as a phone.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Dave,1,When first turned on the phone it said corrupt battery and when I messaged them about it they got back to me once just asking for certain serial numbers and after I gave them to them they never got back to me and now dealing with a bad battery which is getting to be very frustrating. Don‚Äôt purchase from them because they guaranteed about 90% battery but this was way below that and did nothing to help or replace it or anything!

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Gene,3,"Bought this phone for my daughter. Thought that ""renewed"" doesn't really mean much, but yes it does. Phone's mic is weak, isn't always heard on the other end. For example, every time my daughter is on this phone talking to me, I can barely hear her from time to time. He audio keeps disappearing and coming back, even though she has a strong signal. Another problem is with the battery life. It's extremely poor. Phone looses its charge quiet frequently. I turned off all possible notifications. Her phone is very clean, no garbage apps, cache is clean, no internet files, lots of free memory and still battery looses its charge quiet fast."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Mesha,1,Garbage. Stopped working 7 months later. Has a software issue (stuck in a restart loop) and nobody can even fix it. It can‚Äôt be restored or anything. Waste of money. I‚Äôll never buy a electronic device from Amazon.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Skye Collins,1,"I was unaware when I bought this phone that Apple had recalled all IPhone 7s for a ‚Äúno service‚Äù error. Unfortunately, I encountered this error and was unable to connect it to service which completely defeated the point of me buying it. I ended up having to buy an iPhone 11 from Walmart, which costs a little more than this phone did. I recommend choosing a different phone as this was most definitely not worth the money or time I spent trying to set it up."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Allen,1,"I have had this phone for two months. When I first purchased this item it was working perfectly, it had been unlocked, I had activated the phone with my Tmobile sim card and the device would make calls, text messages and all cellular service features.however there was ""other system data"" of 20 GB worth that would not allow me to further update the device. About a month later, due to incapability of updating from the ""other system data"" I could no longer make any phone calls or messages with the device. I reached out to Apple Support to learn that the device did not have an update issue, it was not properly unlocked and had simply become locked back to the original Verizon carrier. The device cannot activate again after resetting from Apple. As i am not a verizon customer nor am I the original owner I can no longer use this phone. It is a brick. It is stuck telling me it cannot be activated. BUYER BEWARE This seller does NOT unlock their phones from the carrier and later after purchase it will become locked and bricked."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Amazon Customer,3,"The phone was great and worked nicely. Within a few days of using the Home Button began to stick. It became more and more difficult to get the Home Button to work. I tried for one whole day, randomly trying, to get a response. I could feel what felt like movement in the backside of the phone with the Home Button, also, when I wisked open screen from the background, there was a feeling of movement and slight noise. I decided if this was an issue now, if I kept the phone the problems could be worse. So, I had 60 days to return and made a decision to return."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sarah L Gunnard,1,The phone was crusty and gross when we got it and it took about 20 minutes for it to turn on to the main menu to set it up. In the middle of setting up the phone the touch screen stopped working. So now I am logged in to iCloud on the phone and I cannot log out. The screen still won‚Äôt turn on so unfortunately I have to send it back while I am still logged in to my apple account which I am not happy about.

I purchased this iPhone for my son because his previous iPhone got the infamous screen glitch and I was not about to shell out $800 on a new phone. I was first nervous about buying used phone but the Amazon renew warranty made me feel a bit comfortable. Anyway I received the phone and it looked great! It looked new. It works just fine and I‚Äôm happy. On top of that I was given a free upgrade to the 128gb phone. I definitely appreciated that. After 2 months I am still impressed and amazed. I highly recommend!

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Travis F.,1,"The seller I bought from (Electronic Deals) sent me a phone with 69% battery health. Even though the Amazon description clearly says 80% or above. The health dropped to 68% the next day, and then wouldn't even hold a charge. If they're not even simply checking if a number in the settings is above 80% (a simple yes or no), then you have to wonder if they're really inspecting these at all. These phones are good prices and it's easy to return them, but still annoying for it to be sent without passing a simple inspection check and potentially leave people without a phone another few days while they return and wait for a new one. I highly recommend everyone to check the battery health right when you receive the phone before you waste your time installing stuff/setting up."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Tag Bunny,5,"Yes, I'm stuck in the iPhone loop with fortunes in data and applications, but my iPhone SE (2016) always had horrible connectivity and the always pathetic battery is now useless. I didn't want to spend >$1K for another new, expensive iPhone to hate (the awful SE was $800) that many complain of poor connectivity, disconnects and Apple's changes that customers despise, but abandoning the iPhone platform would have been bad. One (old) review rated the iPhone7 as #2 for best connectivity, so Amazon's refurbished 7 sounded great! -And it is. -Arrived a day early and I spent half of that transferring the SIM, transferring files and erasing.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Dr. Del Millers,1,"Bought 2 of these phones for my daughters for Christmas and the battery life wasn't even 80% even though it was supposed to be. Unfortunately I didn't send them back then. Four months later, right after the 90 day warranty expired the batteries are completely DEAD! My daughters can't use the phones because as soon as they take them off the charger, even when they've been charging ALL NIGHT, the battery drops to 1% and dies. I have a half dozen of these phones sitting around my house because I keep expecting these Amazon.com sellers to sell good products. So do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THESE CRAPPY CHEAP USED PHONES FROM HERE. Guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and buy an overpriced used phone directly from Apple! I did call the seller's customer service to give them the opportunity to do the right thing and replace the phones, they declined! So I was left with no choice but to write this review as a WARNING to those of you looking for used Iphones. Like I said I've bought at least a half dozen used Iphones from here and always the same problem after a few months after the warranty runs out. And this is from someone who would rather not write a review than write a bad review!"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Noreen,5,Hi to everyone. I was happy when I got the phone. I soon as i put my sim it was perfectly working. I have to charge as it was only 15 percent but that was not a issue to me. The next day never had any issue. I know is not brand new but it worth it. I got the item within 3 days of delivery by FedEx. Thank you for fast delivery as i need it by Monday and came Sunday Morning. I always believe that buying iPhone in amazon is a good idea. Actually this is also my second time i bought a iPhone in amazon. Like me I always get a good one. Good luck for those hunting second hand iPhone. Strongly suggest buy from MOBILESUPPY

If I try to plug it into my car and use apple play it almost always kicks me off my data. It tells me I have no service and have to turn on airplane mode to get it to turn off. Problem is that I usually plug it in and start driving so then I just end up driving without music or directions for awhile until I can get to a red light and do that. The phone was nice when I got it and isn‚Äôt chipped or cracked or anything, I think buying refurbished iPhones might be a bad idea but idk you do you yanno"

The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised. This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones."

The phone volume control is grayed out and will not allow me to change. Volume do not work for headphones also. I found this was a know issue with iPhone 7 and 8 ...faulty Audio IC chip, bad seating to logicboard and bad solder joint. POOR Seller quality. Phone should not have been sent. Simple test, by seller, on the phone call function would have identified the issue and should have not been send. Dissatisfied! Merchant failed to offer a valid option for exchange. They suggested I purchase another phone and return the broken phone for refund. I recommend you DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS MERCHANT!

Time when I unboxed the phone, I noticed a good bit of scratches on the the screen (Not horrible) but could see scratches beyond ‚ÄúArms length‚Äù. Anyway, other parts of the phone was in decent condition and shape; But for some odd reason I charged the phone to 90% and took off the charger. I downloaded a few games (Took maybe 8-10 minutes), and noticed a notification popped up saying (20% battery remaining). So I went to settings to check battery life, and I get another notification about (Battery Significantly Damaged). On the sellers page, it says ‚ÄúAt least 80% battery life‚Äù mine was nothing close to ‚Äú80% life.‚Äù So I contacted the buyer regarding them I received damaged goods which they are slow at replying (Once a day), (After three days of one message a day) and their solution was to buy another one. As of now, I will never buy another phone from this company. Save yourself the time and wasteful battery life. Can‚Äôt even stay on the phone for more than 10 minutes."

I couldn't find a scratch on it, on either the LCD or the body itself. The only negative I could find was the battery capacity. It was less than 80%. With data on, the phone wouldn't last a day. You're lucky to make it to 5pm. Replacing the battery is a necessity. Which I did a week later. Now this iPhone 7 feels and works like brand new. This is an inexpensive way of recycling 3-4 year old tech. And the size is just perfect for one-handed use."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Andrea Turner,1,"Upon use of the device, I discovered that the microphone and speakers did not work with any application. I tried all the tricks (factory reset, double checking sound levels, permissions, flight mode, etc.) and nothing has worked. Contacted service provider, but they said it was a faulty device. Contacted Gadget replay asap and they said they would forward info to techs, who have not replied. I spent a lot of money on this phone and EXPECT it to work like a phone! I am a medical provider and need a reliable device for when I am on call. Very disappointed with the experience and hoping a bad review will get the company to reply to my emails So we can arrange a refund/replacement"

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Tennille Wilton,1,"My mom and I got this phone for my dad who is in a nursing home. Thanks to you-know-what, we are not allowed to see him. All we can do is drop things off for him outside the door and the nurses come out and get it and give it to him. Getting him a phone that could video chat is the only way to have contact. Right off, when it came and I set it up, I noticed the charging port was loose and wiggly and it can't keep connection to charge. I had to bend the cord at a weird angle and set something heavy on it just so it could continue to charge. My dad, who has severe Alzheimer's, cannot figure something like that out, so it just dies on him all the time. Also, 2 charging cords were included and they LOOKED new, all wrapped in plastic packaging, but they were NOT. My mom left one of them with me because she said my dad didn't need 2 and it refused to charge my phone. I thought my phone was bad, so I took it took to a repair shop and I was informed it's not my phone, it's the cord. The cord was 100% bad. I understand the phone is refurbished, but did the seller have to send 2 old junk cords, too? So not only does my dad have a phone with a bad charging port, but he also has a bad cord! The nursing home is 70 miles south of here, so we can't just go get the phone back and try to return it, plus, we can't afford to buy a whole other new phone and we SHOULDN'T HAVE TO, since this phone was advertised as being in perfect condition. Ugh! Run away from this listing as fast as you can unless you LIKE throwing money down the toilet!"

It was a little dirty on the backside of the phone but it was perfectly clean on the front! Don't listen to the bad reviews if you are considering buying this phone. It's cheap and works like an iPhone you'd buy from the apple store. The battery life goes down a little quick but not as bad as my old phone which would go down like 20% in 5 minutes. I recommend!"

I‚Äôm so happy with this phone, it‚Äôs in my favorite color and it works great!! I had A 7 before but the motherboard got corroded, then got an 8 with locked iCloud, got a 5c which doesn‚Äôt update anymore, soon got another 7 which was only at&t compatible, then a 5s that disabled by itself, and then got a 6 which the battery was at 0. Leading up to this phone, I‚Äôm most happy and satisfied with!! This is an amazing product!! Update after having this phone for a couple months:: I‚Äôve had to get it serviced numerous times, first time when they opened it, they said they didn‚Äôt find a single apple genuine part inside. Along with this, they found burn marks inside the charger port and battery. We change the battery to behold another issue. The phone will not connect to aux, Bluetooth, or WiFi. When they opened up the phone they showed numerous locking pins that were no were to be found, causing electrical wires to disconnect if held in a certain way. It‚Äôs been months and I‚Äôm still getting my phone serviced and we are on battery number 2 because of them trying to fix this issue. The seller agreed to pay for the first battery, although I didnt Bother connecting them again due to the issue still not even getting resolved with the iPhone. I‚Äôve spent over $500 at this point on the phone and it still doesn‚Äôt even work. Only LTE works which it overdrafted my acc. Another note to mention. The screen was a cheap glass so when I was Holding it phone one night, the whole screen shattered in my hands."

I turned it on one and tried to activate it using the Quickstart option to merge everything from her previous iPhone to her new one. Something seemed off because when I did that it wouldn‚Äôt connect to the Wi-Fi but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. I went to set it up manually and the Wi-Fi does not work, I have reset the phone multiple times and still nothing. When I first placed the order it got delayed by a few days I was tempted to cancel the order but all of a sudden it had been shipped with two days express shipping.. I assume they sent me a faulty item because they didn‚Äôt want to lose my order. I will be returning this item expecting a full refund and will not be purchasing from this seller again. ZERO STARS**"

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Jeremy Alexander,5,Got is faster than expected. Everything is okay so far. You‚Äôll need to buy a headphone jack adapter for it though. iPhone 7 has no jack plug.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Bob Bruneau,3,"The screen is mounted higher than a stock Apple iPhone, and even with a protector the first time it had a small drop the screen broke on the edges a bit.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Nevertheless,4,"Used iPhone 7: These devices are so sophisticated someone could probably run a small country with one. If $199 is enough to keep me happy for the next 5 years why would I spend $1100?? The SE 2020 is probably also a good choice at $399 (I did consider SE2020, but still ... $400?)"

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Sue,4,"I have been using my phone for about a month, from what I have been able to assess so far the phone has been working properly, the battery holds fairly well, unless playing a game on the phone it drains the battery pretty quickly. The Siri function, the finger print unlock, and camera are pretty amazing, and they are some of the many things that I did not have on my iPhone 4...so this is a wonderful upgrade for me!"

Two days after the warranty expired is when we started to experience battery issues (how Convenient). My daughter kept her phone on the charger all night and it went from 3% to 1%. Now I have an upset 8 year old and no phone. A phone should last way longer than three months without expiriencing these type of problems! Very upsetting!
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Cesi,4,the best thing was the price since it was for my teenager and not knowing how responsible he can be I have not got any complains from him everything works well he so far has been having it in good conditions so its a big plus for me and a proud parent as well showing responsibility

There was something going on with the speaker volume, it would come in very low. Arrived with a battery health in the mid 70s when it‚Äôs supposed to be over 80%. Refunded. I would not recommend buying a phone from this seller and when you go to refund there is a little disclaimer on the sheet that talks about restocking fees. Just avoid."

I took it to an AT&T store and they told me it had to be unlocked by a previous service provider and the only thing I could do was send it back. Pretty disappointing."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,nadia maria parker,4,I like the phone but the only thing that I hate about this phone is that it dies to fast. I had to buy a portable charger just to have for back up.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Bree P,1,Absolutely awful! Phone didn't last 1 day. Should have know. It came with a screen protector on it. Phone was probably garbage when they shipped it. I have attempted to contact the seller but we'll see.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Steve Dunham,5,Fair price for a good phone. Battery is at 80%+ but I have no issues; an overnight charge lasts the entire day. The same phone with a new battery costs hundreds more on AT&T or like sites.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,John C Leigh,4,"The phone is well worth the cost.The only problem I am having is the battery weakens very quickly and must be recharged after few hours. I have a new battery coming from Amazon tomorrow and am hopeful that I will have the skills required to do the work. The battery comes with tools and instructions and I worked for 25 years doing electronic and mechanical tasks,so good luck to me.I have seen reviews where people have said it can't be done and also that the phone would not work with Verizon. I put my old phone chip in and followed the directions on Verizon's website and I can attest that it most surely does work with Verizon."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,apatot,5,"Units were Like New. No scratches, no dings. Battery life is great. Just make sure you buy from Hybrid IT. I bought another set from a different seller and theirs had scratches and battery was junk."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Nancy,1,Don't like it. Went back to Android phone. Androids are so much better in every way. Only thing you can't do on an Android is FaceTime. But you can do the same thing using a different app like duo on an Android. Will ever buy an iPhone again!
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Matt Ratz,3,"This phone arrived when expected and appeared flawless--no imperfections on the screen and not a scratch on the case. However, when I powered it on, I noticed the battery was at 1%. I plugged it in to charge, and after 2 hours, the phone was at 16%. I tried a hard reset; I tried cleaning out the charging port; I tried switching to a 3Amp plug. Nothing got the phone to charge faster. Then, I opened the battery settings and saw, in a big red font, ""Battery requires service."" I've scheduled an appointment to have the battery replaced, but the fact that I'm going to have to shell out an additional $50 on top of the phone's $150 price is negating any savings I might have realized by buying refurbished/ renewed. I will say, the seller has been responsive and helpful, and they even offered to share the cost of a new battery with me. All-in-all, once I get it to work, I'm sure it'll be fine. But it was really disappointing out of the box."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Marley,2,"Battery life was less than sufficient. I have only had this phone for less than 2 months and I have already switched back to my other phone, which I should mention, was being replaced because of its battery life which at this time, lasts longer than the new one. Everything else was great. Did have some issues with screen glitching. Would suggest you only purchase this phone if you are in the middle of waiting for a different new one and your current phone is not usable."

I ended up ordering elsewhere and I received my phone much quicker and it costed the same amount of money and it‚Äôs a brand new phone. I would avoid buying from them if possible.

I tried a soft reset and could hear it trying to reset, but just kept turning off and on with the apple flashing for 2 days straight. I took it to a phone repair place and they said there was no hope. DON""T ORDER A PHONE FROM THEM! You'll waste money on a phone that will last just as long as the time in which you can no longer get a refund. NOT RECCOMMENDED"
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,FeFe,5,"I bought this for my teenage son to replace his old phone. The phone came in nearly perfect condition-- just a tiny, barely noticeable, scratch on the back. I purchased it ""fully unlocked"" so he'd be able to go with any mobile service.. we placed a MetroPCS sim card in it, and it's been fine. My only complaint is that the battery on iPhones in general do not last as long compared to his old android phone (Samsung Galaxy A20 & yes I'm a Samsung lover to the end) but this is what he wanted. Overall.. the purchase was worth it, in my opinion."

After some research, it turns out that a long production run of iPhone 7's have a cellular hardware defect. This phone was conveniently a few months out of the manufacturers warranty period when it failed. I worked through debugging the failure with apple support and it turns out that my phone had literally 51 previously recorded enhanced logs confirming my phone had this issue. Additionally, the battery life on my phone was laughably bad."

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Marcia Lewis,1,This phone is from Japan and it's not compatible with the US. I was hours at Verizon store trying to get my phone to work and finally they realized that the phone code isn't compatible to the US code but Japan. It's a scam and Amazon should ban them from selling.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Kiersten Mixon,1,This phone has been giving me problems since it has arrived. The battery stays dead even after hours of charge if. Even the charger that came with the phone no longer works. It‚Äôs frustrating because i got it for my 8 year old autistic son who now doesn‚Äôt want me return it so that I can get a better quality phone if it means he won‚Äôt have one until then. The battery over heats and doesn‚Äôt keep any type of charge. And the touch works when it wants to.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Khan,4,"Overall, I am glad I bought this. It's definitely a step up from my iPhone 5s, with a bigger screen and much more storage. It may be my imagination, but the battery life seems not to be impressive at all, but that may be due to the iOS it is running rather than the hardware. Worth the money, and recommended."
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Donald Wyman,5,"Well, the first phone's battery was not very good. The second phone's battery was better, but not quite what it should have been. The 3rd phone's battery is perfect. all three phone's were in excellent shape and worked perfectly and looked brand new. The company (Kanga), stood behind their products and made it right in the end. It took some time and effort on my part, which they could have avoided with a little better quality control. In the end, however they did everything else very well and were exceptional in their customer service. I would recommend this company now and in the future!"

Took it to Best Buy to Geek Squad and they are telling me since the phone has no warranty, I will have to pay 330 for another iphone 7. I have completely lost my money as Amazon is not issuing my refund. Kept the phone for weeks to see if I can get it fixed but no go. Geek Squad is telling me that my phone isn't really unlocked.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,Tara Kline,1,Dislike. The battery dies quickly. The touchscreen sometimes sends me to an app I didn‚Äôt click. And the charger doesn‚Äôt stay in place.

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,911 Dispatcher,4,"Purchased this for a friend and as I know it is used it did come with quite a few blemishes, scratches etc. The screen had been replaced as you can see where the home button and also edges don‚Äôt completely line up. Making the home button harder to depress. Phone works fairly well other than maybe a small software glitch? Every time she opens her email the phone rings twice like someone is calling but no one is. Took us awhile to figure that one out, lol. Battery and function otherwise is acceptable. A bit over priced for a used phone"

"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,A Manwill,1,The model A1660 has a known issue that the modem goes out. Will not connect to cellular network. Since it is refurbished it is out of the coverage time for it to be repaired for free and Apple will charge you $300 to repair. The phone functioned fine but they are a time bomb. They will go out at any time and while everything else works fine it will no longer with any carrier. Look up iPhone 7 Carrier service failed to update. So buy at your own risk.
"Apple iPhone 7, 32GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",4.2,9848,John,3,"the first had battery capacity of 72% of new in both but was advertised as 80% or better. the first had a bad transmitter chip (they offered to replace with 7plus but after i had already returned it), the second (by a different company) had a battery at 71% and we made arrangements to address the battery issues. but still was a big hassle all around."

DO NOT buy. I bought 2 and they both worked fine through the small 90day warranty period. We started having problems with about 9months in. The Rear camera doesn't work at all and sometimes the front camera doesn't either. Now we are getting a cellular data Error. ""cellular update failed"" and ""an update is required to use cellular data on this iPhone"". After updates, resets and restores we continue to get errors. I tried calling the vendor and they will not help either."

I plugged it to the charger it came with and left it for a while and it didn't even charge. I swapped plugs and it still didn't charge or turn on. Not to mention how disappointed I am with the physical appearance. Its very scratched from the back and it still has the markings of the case it was previously on. I'm returning. This is ridiculous.
